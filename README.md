# Coffee Shop Microservices

## Description


The Coffee Shop Microservices project is a distributed system built for managing various aspects of a coffee shop, including product inventory, order notifications, and service resilience. The system is composed of multiple microservices, including an API Gateway, Service Registry, Distributed Logging, Product Service, Inventory Service, PostgreSQL Database, MongoDB, Notification Service, Twilio integration, Resilience4j, and HashiCorp Vault. This README file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.

## Features
- API Gateway: The API Gateway acts as a single entry point for all API requests. It handles routing, load balancing, authentication, and request/response transformations.

- Service Registry: The Service Registry keeps track of all available services in the system. It stores service metadata, such as service name, version, and location, allowing the API Gateway to dynamically discover and route requests to the appropriate services.

- Distributed Logging: The Distributed Logging component collects and stores logs generated by the microservices. It helps in monitoring, debugging, and tracing requests across the system.

- Product Service: The Product Service manages the coffee shop's product inventory. It provides APIs for retrieving product information, creating/updating products, and handling inventory-related operations.

- Inventory Service: The Inventory Service tracks the stock levels of products. It integrates with the Product Service and updates the inventory as orders are placed or products are restocked.

- PostgreSQL Database: The PostgreSQL database stores persistent data related to the coffee shop, such as product details, order information, and customer profiles.

- MongoDB: The MongoDB database is used for storing non-relational data, such as logs, notifications, and other unstructured data generated by the microservices.

- Notification Service: The Notification Service handles order notifications to customers. It integrates with 

- Twilio for sending SMS notifications.

- Twilio Integration: Twilio is integrated into the system to send SMS notifications to customers about their orders.

- Resilience4j: Resilience4j is a fault tolerance library used to improve the resilience and stability of the microservices. It provides features like circuit breakers, rate limiting, and retry mechanisms.

- HashiCorp Vault: HashiCorp Vault is used for secure storage and management of sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, and other secrets.

## TODO

- Dockerize each application individually and orchestrate using Kubernetes

- Use SAGA Design pattern to implement Distributed Atomic transactions

- Implement JWT autnentication and provide UI components for the required services
